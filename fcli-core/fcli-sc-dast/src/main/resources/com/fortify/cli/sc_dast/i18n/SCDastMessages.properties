# Make sure none of the commands inherit usage header or description of the top-level fcli command
# Note that we define these as usage.* whereas our parent bundle defines fcli.usage.* (with fcli prefix).
# For some reason, overriding fcli.usage.* doesn't work.

# fcli sc-dast
fcli.sc-dast.usage.header = Interact with Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST).
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.0 = The commands in this module allow for interacting with \
  Fortify ScanCentral DAST (SC-DAST). This includes functionality like submitting and \
  managing DAST scan requests and results.  
fcli.sc-dast.usage.description.1 = %nAll commands in this module require require an SSC session \
  that has been configured for interacting with ScanCentral DAST. Such an SSC session can be \
  created through the 'fcli ssc session login' command. As a best practice, the \
  'fcli ssc session logout' command should be run to terminate the session when there are no \
  more activities to be performed.  

# Shared options
fcli.sc-dast.server-queries = Complementary to the -q / --query option (which performs client-side \
  filtering), this option accepts one or more comma-separated ScanCentral DAST request parameters \
  to perform server-side filtering, for example 'searchText=some-text'. See the ScanCentral DAST \
  API documentation for information on which request parameters are supported on individual endpoints. 
  
# fcli sc-dast rest
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.header = Interact with ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoints.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.usage.description = These commands allow for direct interaction with ScanCentral DAST \
  REST API endpoints, somewhat similar to using 'curl' but benefiting from standard fcli functionality \
  like session management (no need to manually specify Authorization header), rich output formatting \
  options, and query functionality.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.usage.header = Call an individual Fortify ScanCentral DAST REST API endpoint. 
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.no-paging = By default, this command will load all pages of data from ScanCentral \
  DAST (from the given offset if specified as a request parameter). Use this option to return only a \
  single page. 
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.no-transform = By default, this command performs generic transformations on \
  ScanCentral DAST REST responses, like only outputting the actual response data (contents of the \
  'item' or 'items' property). Use this option to output the original response contents without transformations.
fcli.sc-dast.rest.call.transform = This option allows for performing custom transformations on the response \
  data based on a Spring Expression Language (SpEL) expression. For example, this allows for retrieving \
  data from sub-properties, or using project selection/projection. Note that the expression operates on \
  the raw response, as if --no-transform was specified before evaluating the expression.

# fcli sc-dast scan
scan-id's[0] = One or more scan id's.
scan-id[0] = Single scan id.
scan = Single scan id.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral DAST scans and results.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.download.usage.header = Download scan fpr, logs, results, settings or site tree. 
fcli.sc-dast.scan.download.type = Artifact type to download: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.download.file = Optional output file name.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.get.usage.header = Get the details for a single scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.list.usage.header = List and query scans.
# TODO Describe date/time format for these options
fcli.sc-dast.scan.list.started-after = List scans started after the specified date.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.list.started-before = List scans started before the specified date.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.usage.header = Start a new scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.name = The name for this scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.overrides-file = File containing override values for the scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.mode = Overrides the scan mode. Accepted values are: ${COMPLETION-CANDIDATES}.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.start.login-macro = Overrides the scan login macro binary file id.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.header = Wait for one or more scans to reach or exit specified scan statuses.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.0 = Although this command offers a lot of options to cover many \
  different use cases, you can simply pass a scan id (possibly stored using --store on the 'scan start' \
  command) to wait for completion of a single scan. If any error state or unknown state is detected, an \
  exception will be thrown.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.1 = %nThe following states are currently known by fcli:
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.usage.description.2 = ${fcli.sc-dast.scan.states:-See fcli help output}
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.until=Wait until either any or all scans match. If neither --until or --while are specified, default is to wait until all scans match.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.while=Wait while either any or all scans match.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.wait-for.any-state=One or more scan states against which to match the given scans.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.header = Import scan findings.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.import-findings.usage.description = This command imports scan findings into ScanCentral DAST. With ScanCentral DAST, scan findings are usually imported automatically, but there may be cases where this operation needs to be triggered explicitly. Please see the ScanCentral DAST documentation for more information.   
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.header = Publish scan results.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.publish.usage.description = This command publishes scan results to SSC. This can be used for publishing the results if 'Submit for Triage' was not enabled in the scan configuration.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.complete.usage.header = Complete a scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.delete.usage.header = Delete a scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.pause.usage.header = Pause a scan.
fcli.sc-dast.scan.resume.usage.header = Resume a scan

# fcli sc-dast scan-policy

# fcli sc-dast sensor
fcli.sc-dast.sensor.usage.header = Manage ScanCentral DAST sensors.
fcli.sc-dast.sensor.disable.usage.header = Disable a sensor.
fcli.sc-dast.sensor.enable.usage.header = enable a sensor.
fcli.sc-dast.sensor.get.usage.header = Get the details for a single sensor.
