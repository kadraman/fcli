# For now, this template uses latest release state to generate PR decorations.
# See corresponding .bak file is SSC module for an example of how to better
# implement this, once FoD supports retrieving new/re-introduced/removed isses
# for a particular scan id/PR number/commit id.

  header: (PREVIEW) Add GitHub Pull Request review comments.  
  description: |
    This action adds review comments to a GitHub Pull Request. Currently
    this is marked as PREVIEW as we build out this functionality; later
    versions may have different behavior and/or require different action
    parameters. 
    
    The current implementation simply compares current scan results 
    against previous scan results in the given FoD release, listing 
    all new, re-introduced and removed issues in a new PR comment. 
    
    For best results, this fcli action should only be run on GitHub 
    pull_request triggers. Upon PR creation, a new FoD release should 
    be created, copying state from the FoD release that represents the 
    branch into which the PR will be merged, and a new scan should be 
    run on the current PR branch before invoking this fcli action.
    
    This will ensure that scan results for the current PR will be
    compared against the latest scan results for the target branch
    upon PR creation. Optionally, new scans can be run upon PR changes,
    creating new PR comments that show the issue delta compared to the
    previous scan for this PR.
