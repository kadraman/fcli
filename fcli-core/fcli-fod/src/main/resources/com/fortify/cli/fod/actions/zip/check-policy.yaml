usage:
  header: Check security policy. 
  description: |
    This action checks the outcome of the FoD Security Policy, returning a non-zero
    exit code if FoD Security Policy status is Fail. Having this defined in an fcli
    action allows for users to implement custom security policy checks through a
    custom action, for example if they need more granuality than what's provided
    by the standard FoD Security Policy.

config:
  rest.target.default: fod
      
cli.options:
  release:
    alias: rel
    description: "Required release id or <appName>:[<microserviceName>:]<releaseName>"
  
steps:
  - var.set:
      rel: ${#fod.release(cli.release)}
  - check:
    - displayName: FoD Security Policy must Pass
      passIf:      ${rel.isPassed}
