usage:
  header: Set up application release. 
  description: |
    This action allows for preparing an application release for running an application
    security scan. It will create the application and/or release if they do not exist
    yet, and optionally configure scan settings. For now, only static scan setup is
    supported, including optional software composition analysis. Support for other 
    scan types like Dynamic or Mobile may be added in the future, or you may consider 
    implementing a custom setup action to set up other scan types.
    
    Although the same functionality can be achieved by manually running the various 
    fcli commands used by this action, like `fcli fod release create` and 
    `fcli fod sast-scan setup`, this action provides a convenient and standardized
    approach for running those commands, providing default values for many of the
    required options. 
    
    To provide even more consistency across CI/CD pipelines in your organization, it
    is recommended to implement one or more custom setup actions that provide suitable
    default values or even hard-coded, non-overridable values for the various options,
    for example based on business unit, team, and/or application type. Such custom 
    actions could for example set standard application or release attributes for a 
    particular type of application to be scanned. Alternative to implementing multiple 
    custom actions, you may also consider implementing a single custom action that takes 
    for example a --profile option to select between different profiles that each define 
    appropriate option values and setup commands to run.
