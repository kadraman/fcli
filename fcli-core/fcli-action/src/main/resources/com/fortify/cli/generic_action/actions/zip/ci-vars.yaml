  header: Collect CI-specific data
  description: |
    (Work in progress)
    This action collects CI-specific data, for example from CI-specific environment
    variables, and outputs this data in a CI-agnostic JSON object. This is primarily
    used by the SSC/FoD-specific 'ci' actions, but may also be useful for other (custom)
    actions.

config:
  output: immediate
  
steps:
  - var.set:
      ci.x: X value
      ci.y: Y value
  - out.write:
      stdout: ${ci}
