formatters:
  fod:
    session:
      - names: FOD_URL
        desc: >-  
          Fortify on Demand URL, for example https://ams.fortify.com. This must be rendered by the CI/CD system
          as plain text, not as a masked secret/variable.
      - names: FOD_CLIENT_ID\nFOD_CLIENT_SECRET
        desc: >-
          Required when authenticating with an API key: Fortify on Demand Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).
      - names: FOD_TENANT\nFOD_USER\nFOD_PASSWORD
        desc: >-
          Required when authenticating with user credentials: Fortify on Demand tenant, user and password. It is
          recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.
      - names: FOD_LOGIN_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          Extra login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see 
          `fcli fod session login` documentation.
    ci:
      - names: FOD_RELEASE
        desc: >-
          Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This should be specified as `<app-name>:<release-name>`
          (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices 
          applications). Default value is based on repository and branch name, for example myOrg/myRepo:myBranch.
          Note that you'll need to explicitly configure FOD_RELEASE for microservices applications, as the default
          value lacks a microservice name.
  ssc:
    session:
      - names: SSC_URL
        desc: >-
            Software Security Center (SSC) URL, for example https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/. This must be 
            rendered by the CI/CD system as plain text, not as a masked secret/variable.
      - names: SSC_TOKEN
        desc: >-
            Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a CIToken.
      - names: SSC_USER\nSSC_PASSWORD
        desc: >-
            Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.
      - names: SC_SAST_TOKEN
        desc: >-
            ScanCentral SAST Client Authentication Token for authenticating with ScanCentral SAST Controller. This 
            environment variable is required when running a ScanCentral SAST scan.
      # TODO Add DEBRICKED_TOKEN once implemented
      - names: SSC_LOGIN_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
            Extra SSC login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; 
            see `fcli ssc session login` documentation.        
    ci:
      - names: SSC_APPVERSION
        desc: >-
            Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This should be specified as `<app-name>:<version-name>`. 
            Default value is based on repository and branch name, for example myOrg/myRepo:myBranch.
