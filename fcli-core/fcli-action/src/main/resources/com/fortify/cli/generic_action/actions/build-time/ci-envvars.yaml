      - names: FOD_URL
        desc: >-  
          Fortify on Demand URL, for example `https://ams.fortify.com`. This must be rendered by the CI/CD system
          as plain text, not as a masked secret/variable.
      - names: FOD_CLIENT_ID\nFOD_CLIENT_SECRET
        desc: >-
          Required when authenticating with an API key: Fortify on Demand Client ID (API key) and Secret (API secret).
      - names: FOD_TENANT\nFOD_USER\nFOD_PASSWORD
        desc: >-
          Required when authenticating with user credentials: Fortify on Demand tenant, user and password. It is
          recommended to use a Personal Access Token instead of an actual user password.
      - names: FOD_LOGIN_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          Extra login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; see 
          `fcli fod session login` documentation.
    preScan:
      - names: FOD_RELEASE
        desc: >-
          Fortify on Demand release to use with this action. This should be specified as `<app-name>:<release-name>`
          (for non-microservices applications) or `<app-name>:<microservice-name>:<release-name>` (for microservices 
          applications). Default value is based on repository and branch name, for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.
          Note that you'll need to explicitly configure `FOD_RELEASE` for microservices applications, as the default
          value lacks a microservice name.
      - names: DO_SETUP\nSETUP_ACTION\nSETUP_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_SETUP` is set not set to `false`, the application and/or release will be created if they do not
          yet exist, and static scan settings will be configured if not configured already, using the
          fcli-provided `setup-release` action, or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through
          `SETUP_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`
          environment variable.\n\nDepending on your Git workflow, it is recommended to copy state from the
          release representing your default branch by passing the `--copy-from` option through
          `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`. To allow this action to create new applications, depending on FoD version,
          you may (also) need to provide the `--app-owner <user id or name>` option through `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`.
    scan:
      - names: DO_SAST_SCAN\nSAST_SCAN_EXTRA_OPTS\nDO_SAST_WAIT
        desc: >-
          For now, this fcli action only supports running a SAST scan, which is enabled by default. The
          `SAST_SCAN_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable can be used to pass extra options to the `fcli fod sast-scan start`
          command. By default, this action will wait until the scan has been completed, unless `DO_SAST_WAIT`
          is set to `false`; note that any post-scan tasks will be skipped in this case.
    postScan:
      - names: DO_RELEASE_SUMMARY\nRELEASE_SUMMARY_ACTION\nRELEASE_SUMMARY_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_RELEASE_SUMMARY` is not set to `false`, a release summary will be generated using the
          fcli-provided `release-summary` action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through
          `RELEASE_SUMMARY_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be specified through the
          `RELEASE_SUMMARY_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow
          unsigned custom actions to be used.
      - names: DO_CHECK_POLICY\nCHECK_POLICY_ACTION\nCHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_CHECK_POLICY` is set to true (implied if any of the other two `CHECK_POLICY_*` variables
          are set), a policy check will be run after scan completion using the fcli-provided
          `check-policy` action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through
          `CHECK_POLICY_ACTION`. Extra options for a custom fcli action can be passed through the
          `CHECK_POLICY_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow
          unsigned custom actions to be used.
      - names: DO_PR_COMMENT\nPR_COMMENT_ACTION\nPR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          (PREVIEW) If `DO_PR_COMMENT` is set to true (implied if any of the other two `PR_COMMENT_*` variables
          are set), a Pull Request or Merge Request comment will be generated using an fcli-provided action
          matching the current CI system like `github-pr-comment` or, if specified, the custom fcli action
          specified through `PR_COMMENT_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be specified through
          the `PR_COMMENT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow unsigned
          custom actions to be used.
      - names: DO_SAST_EXPORT\nSAST_EXPORT_ACTION\nSAST_EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_SAST_EXPORT` is not set to `false` and a SAST scan was completed, the SAST vulnerability
          data will be exported into a CI-specific format using an fcli-provided action matching the current
          CI system like `github-sast-report` or `gitlab-sast-report`, or, if specified, the custom fcli action
          specified through `SAST_EXPORT_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be specified through the
          `SAST_EXPORT_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow unsigned custom
          actions to be used.

            Software Security Center (SSC) URL, for example `https://ssc.customer.fortifyhosted.net/`. This must be 
            rendered by the CI/CD system as plain text, not as a masked secret/variable.
      - names: SSC_TOKEN
        desc: >-
            Required when authenticating with an SSC token (recommended). Most actions should work fine with a CIToken.
      - names: SSC_USER\nSSC_PASSWORD
        desc: >-
            Required when authenticating with SSC user credentials.
      - names: SC_SAST_TOKEN
        desc: >-
            ScanCentral SAST Client Authentication Token for authenticating with ScanCentral SAST Controller. This 
            environment variable is required when running a ScanCentral SAST scan.
      # TODO Add DEBRICKED_TOKEN once implemented
      - names: SSC_LOGIN_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
            Extra SSC login options, for example for disabling SSL checks or changing connection time-outs; 
            see `fcli ssc session login` documentation.        
    preScan:
      - names: SSC_APPVERSION
        desc: >-
          Fortify SSC application version to use with this action. This should be specified as `<app-name>:<version-name>`. 
          Default value is based on repository and branch name, for example `myOrg/myRepo:myBranch`.
      - names: DO_SETUP\nSETUP_ACTION\nSETUP_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_SETUP` is set not set to `false`, the application and/or version will be created if they do not yet
          exist using the fcli-provided `setup-appversion` action, or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified
          through `SETUP_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be passed through the `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS` 
          environment variable.\n\nDepending on your Git workflow, it is recommended to copy state from the
          application version representing your default branch by passing the `--copy-from` option through
          `SETUP_EXTRA_OPTS`.

            command. By default, this action will wait until the scan has been completed, unless `DO_SAST_WAIT`
            is set to `false`; note that any post-scan tasks will be skipped in this case.
    postScan:
      - names: DO_APPVERSION_SUMMARY\nAPPVERSION_SUMMARY_ACTION\nAPPVERSION_SUMMARY_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >-
          If `DO_APPVERSION_SUMMARY` is not set to `false`, an application version summary will be generated using the
          fcli-provided `appversion-summary` action or, if specified, the custom fcli action specified through
          `APPVERSION_SUMMARY_ACTION`. Extra options for the fcli action can be specified through the
          `APPVERSION_SUMMARY_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable, which may include fcli options to allow
          unsigned custom actions to be used.

    package:
      - names: PACKAGE_ACTION\nPACKAGE_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTS
        desc: >- 
          By default, when running a SAST scan, the fcli `package` action is used to (optionally) package the source code
          to be scanned; see next entry for information on how to configure the default `package` action. If the standard
          fcli `package` action doesn't meet your needs, for example if you want to perform a local translation using
          Fortify Static Code Analyzer, you can use `PACKAGE_ACTION` to use a custom action for packaging, optionally
          providing extra options to this custom action through the `PACKAGE_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTS` environment variable.
          Note that any custom action must set the `global.package.output` action variable, pointing to the package or
          MBS file to be scanned.
      - names: USE_PACKAGE\nPACKAGE_EXTRA_OPTS\nSC_CLIENT_VERSION\nSOURCE_DIR\nDO_PACKAGE_DEBUG\nTOOL_DEFINITIONS
        desc: >-
          These environment variables define packaging behavior. If `USE_PACKAGE` is specified, packaging will be skipped
          and the given package or MBS file (which must already exist) will be used. To pass additional options to the
          `scancentral package` command like `-bt` or `-bf`, use `PACKAGE_EXTRA_OPTS`.\nBy default:\n
          - Latest available ScanCentral Client version will be used for packaging; use `SC_CLIENT_VERSION`
          to specify a different version.\n
          - Current working directory will be packaged; use `SOURCE_DIR` to package a different directory.\n
          - Debug logging for Scancentral Client is disabled; set `DO_PACKAGE_DEBUG` to true to enable debug logging.\n
          - Tool definitions to identify available ScanCentral Client versions will be downloaded from the default
          location; use `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` to use customized tool definitions.\n
