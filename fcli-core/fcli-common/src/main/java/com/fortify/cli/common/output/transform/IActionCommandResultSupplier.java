 * This interface can be implemented by commands to return the action

 * should usually be in one of the following formats:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Past tense of the command name in upper case, i.e. "DELETED", if
 *      the remote system performs the requested actions immediately</li>
 *  <li>Command name in upper case followed by "_REQUESTED", i.e. 
 *      "DELETE_REQUESTED", if the remote system performs the requested 
 *      actions in the background, in which case the actions may not have 
 *      been completed yet by the time we output the results.</li>
