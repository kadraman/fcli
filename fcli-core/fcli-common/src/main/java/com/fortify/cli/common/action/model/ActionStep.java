        Set one or more variables values for use in later action steps. This step takes a list of variables to \
        set, with each list item taking a single yaml property that represents the variable name to set, which \
        may be specified as an SpEL template expression. 
        
        Based on the format of the variable name, this step can either set/replace a single-value variable, \
        set/replace a property on a variable containing a set of properties, or append a value to an array-type \
        variable. By default, variables are only accessible by the current fcli action, unless they are prefixed \
        with 'global.', in which case they are also accessible by other actions that execute within the context \
        of a single fcli command-line invocation. For example, if action 1 uses the run.fcli step to execute action \
        2, any global variables set in action 1 will be accessibly by action 2, and vice versa. 
        
        Following are some examples that show how to specify the operation to perform, and thereby implicitly \
        declaring the variable type:
        
        # Set/replace the single-value variable named 'var1'
        var1: ...
        
        # Set/replace properties 'prop1' and 'prop2' on variable 'var2'
        var2.prop1: ...
        var2.prop2: ...
        
        # Append two items to the array-type variable 'var3' (two trailing dots) 
        var3..: ...
        var3..: ...
        
        # Same as above, but setting global variables:
        global.var1: ...
        global.var2.prop1: ...
        global.var2.prop2: ...
        global.var3..: ...
        global.var3..: ...
        
        # The following would be illegal, as a variable cannot contain both
        # a set of properties and an array:
        var4.prop1: ...
        var4..: ...
        
        Due to this syntax, variable names cannot contain dots like 'var.1', as '1' would be \
        interpreted as a property name on the 'var' variable. Property names may contain dots \
        though, so 'var5.x.y' would be intepreted as property name 'x.y' on 'var5'.
        
        Values may be specified as either an SpEL template expression, or as 'value' and 'fmt' \
        properties. An 'if' property is also supported to conditionally set the variable. If \
        formatter is specified, the given formatter from the 'formatters' section will be used to \
        format the given value, or, if no value is given, the formatter will be evaluated against \
        the set of all variables. Some examples:
        
        global.name: John Doe
        simpleValue1: Hello ${global.name}
        formattedValue1: {fmt: myFormatter, if: "${someExpression}"}
        formatterValue2: {value: "${myVar}", fmt: "${myVarFormatterExpression}"}     
        
        Within a single 'var.set*' step, variables are processed in the order that they are \
        declared, allowing earlier declared variables to be referenced by variables or \
        formatters that are declared later in the same step.

        For paged REST requests, a single 'rest.call' instruction will execute multiple REST \
        requests to load the individual pages. The response of each individual REST request \
        will be stored as local action variables. For example, given a rest.call identifier 'x' \
        the following local action variables will be set:
        
        x: The processed response
        x_raw: The raw, unprocessed response
        x_exception: Java Exception instance if the request failed
        
        These variables can be referenced only within the current 'rest.call' map entry, for \
        example by 'log.progress', 'on.success', and 'records.for-each'. They are not accessible 
        by later steps or other map entries within the same 'rest.call' step. If you wish to make \
        any data produced by the REST call available to later steps, you'll need to use 'var.*' \
        steps in either 'on.success' or 'records.for-each' instructions.
         
        Note that multiple REST calls defined within a single 'rest.call' step will be executed \
        in the specified order, but the requests are built independent of each other. As such, \
        within a single 'rest.call' step, variables set by one 'rest.call' map entry cannot be \
        accessed in the request definition (uri, query, body, ...) of another map entry. The \
        reason is that for target systems that supports bulk requests (like SSC), multiple \
        requests within a single 'rest.call' instruction may be combined into a single bulk \
        request, so none of the REST responses will be available yet while building the bulk \
        request. If you need to use the output from one REST call as input for another REST \
        call, these REST calls should be defined in separate 'rest.call' steps.

        the same 'run.fcli' step) to access the output of the fcli command, like stdout, stderr, and \
        exit code that were produced by the fcli command, depending on step configuration. For example,
