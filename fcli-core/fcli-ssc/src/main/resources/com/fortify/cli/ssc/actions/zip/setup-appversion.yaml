usage:
  header: Set up application version. 
  description: |
      This action allows for preparing an application version for running an application
      security scan, creating the application and/or release if they do not exist yet.
      
      Although the same functionality can be achieved by manually running the 
      `fcli ssc appversion create` command, this action provides a convenient and 
      standardized approach for running this command with some default options like
      `--skip-if-exists` and `--auto-required-attrs`.
      
      To provide even more consistency across CI/CD pipelines in your organization, it
      is recommended to implement one or more custom setup actions that provide suitable
      default values or even hard-coded, non-overridable values for the various options,
      for example based on business unit, team, and/or application type. Such custom 
      actions could for example set standard application version attributes for a 
      particular type of application to be scanned. Alternative to implementing multiple 
      custom actions, you may also consider implementing a single custom action that takes 
      for example a --profile option to select between different profiles that each define 
      appropriate option values and setup commands to run.
