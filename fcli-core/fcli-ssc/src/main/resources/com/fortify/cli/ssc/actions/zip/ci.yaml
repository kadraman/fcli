  header: (PREVIEW) Run SSC CI pipeline
  description: |
    (Work in progress)
    This action can be used to run a full, standardized CI pipeline that performs the
    following activities:
    - Create & configure SSC application version if needed
    - Package source code
    - Submit SAST scan request
    - Wait for SAST scan completion
    - Perform post-scan activities, like checking policy outcome, exporting results, ...
    
    Configuration for this fcli action is done through environment variables; the
    table below lists the environment variables supported by this action.
            
    ::include:/ci-envvars-ssc.ci.txt

config:
  output: immediate
  rest.target.default: ssc
  
steps:
  # Configure module; allows for copying/re-using similar #actionCmd invocations in FoD ci action
  - var.set:
      module: ssc
      
  # Run ci-vars action to obtain CI data
  - run.fcli:

            throw: SSC application version must be specified through SSC_APPVERSION environment variable
            
  # Configure CI steps to be run
  # Note that any data produced by the actual steps cannot be referenced here. For example,
  # as at this point we haven't run the package action yet, we can't add '-f ${global.package.output}'
  # in sastStart.args; this option will need to be passed explicitly on the sastStart fcli invocation.
